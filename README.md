# Introduction
The AutoCirque toolbox includes three GIS tools: 1) Cirque Auto-Delineation; 2) Cirque Delineation by Threshold Features; and 3) Cirque Potential Thresholds. All these tools are written in python and imported into ArcGIS as python script tools. These tools have been tested successfully for different ArcGIS versions after 10.5 and ArcGIS Pro 2.8. All python scripts have been imported to their corresponding tools; therefore, the user can directly download the *.tbx file and run it in ArcGIS or ArcGIS pro. The python codes are also included in the github site. The user can check the codes and comtinue imporving this toolbox. 

Cirque Auto-Delineation is a fully automated tool to delineate cirque outlines. The input parameters include DEM, a minimum elevation for cirques, the minimum source area to start a stream, the minimum total contributing area for a first order stream before joining another stream, the minimum circularity index, the minimum percentages of steep (>31°) and gentle (<20°) slope areas, and the minimum headwall slope, as well as its allowable flexibility, for the cirques. The DEM is recommended to have a UTM projection to ensure the correct calculations of DEM-related metrics without the specification of a Z-factor. The output parameters include the 3D profiles for each first order stream related to the potential cirques, the potential threshold points and cross sections along the profiles, and the delineated potential cirque outlines.

Cirque Delineation By Threshold Features is the semi-automated tool to delineate the cirques based on DEM and user specified cirque threshold features (points or cross sections). The input parameters of this tool include DEM, the threshold points or cross sections, the minimum source area to start a stream, and the minimum headwall slope, as well as its allowable flexibility, for the cirques. The output of this tool is the delineated cirque outlines.

The cirque threshold points can be prepared by digitizing the points in ArcGIS or Google Earth (then transfer the KML file to ArcGIS). In terms of the cross sections, the user can digitize the linear features in ArcGIS or Google Earth to define the low margins of the cirques. The user can also use the interpolate 3D lines in the 3D Analyst Toolbar in ArcGIS to draw the potential cross sections and then convert the drawn graphic objects to feature classes using the Convert Graphics To Features tool in ArcGIS. 

A Cirque Potential Thresholds tool is also developed to identify potential cirque threshold points and cross sections along the stream profile. This tool generates a set of potential threshold points and cross sections along the first order stream, so that the user can select the appropriate threshold features to delineate cirques using the Cirque Delineation by Threshold Features tool. The input parameters of this tool include DEM, a minimum elevation for cirques, the minimum source area to start a stream, and the minimum total contributing area for a first order stream before joining another stream. The output parameters include the 3D profiles, the potential threshold points, and the potential threshold cross sections along the profiles.

# How to download and use it in ArcGIS or ArcGIS Pro
The github site include a AutoCirque.tbx file and a python folder, including three python files associated with the three tools. The codes have been imported to ArcGIS Toolbox so that it is not necessary to download the python folder in order to use this toolbox in ArcGIS and ArcGIS Pro. The user can simply download the tbx file to their computer and run these three tools in ArcGIS or ArcGIS Pro.
